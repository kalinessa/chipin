# Chip In!
An app intended to connect the audience with various charitable causes.
## Inspiration
Our main inspiration was that we came up with so many different issues that could use help, that we realized that we could just combine all of them into an app that allowed you to contribute in the solutions for any of these different issues.
## What it does
Our app's primary focus is educating users about humanitarian crises throughout the world and providing them with the knowledge and resources to make a difference, all in an clean, concise, and organized manner. For example, one of our app's main features is the donating feature: users can look through different issues, look for organizations trying to help out with that issue, and donate to that organization.
## How we built it
We built our app in the code.org platform, which uses Javascript, and made a mockup of our vision for the MRTK3 aspect of our project using Echo3D's AR lens. Before we started building though, we first made rough drafts of all our screens on paper, writing down notes on the side.
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we encountered was narrowing down our ideas. We found ourselves constantly coming up with new ideas and expansions to our old ideas to implement in our project, so we made the conscious decision to keep these ideas in mind, but mostly focus on producing a base finished product. Another challenge we faced was the implementation of MRTK3 as a way to visualize areas of crises; at first, we wanted to fully implement this feature, but after struggling heavily and realizing how much of a time constraint it was, we decided to instead make a mockup using Echo3D's AR lens: we used Echo3D to display a globe that, if the feature were fully implemented with MRTK3, would take you to a location you select on it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are all proud we were able to work as a team effectively, each of us working on different parts of the project which we later combined to produce our finished product, while also enjoying ourselves in the hackathon and not spending all our time in front of a computer.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about having a team plan and schedule ahead of time, along with routinely checking in with each other to make sure progress was being made. We practiced things such as making a rough draft of all the screens on paper, writing down the set of tasks we were currently working on and those that needed to be worked on next on the board, and designating a certain amount of time for different tasks
## What's next for Chip In!
We want to expand our app to include different features of MRTK3, along with fully implementing some of the other features we could not get to, such as being able to see the progress of organizations you donated to.
